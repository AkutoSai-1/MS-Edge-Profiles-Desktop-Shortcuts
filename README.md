Press y and enter.

Then you would navigate to where you have the .ps1 file with

`cd C:\Users\*Name*\*Where the file is*`

then type\
`.\*Name*.ps1`

after it finishes you can type

*Optional*

`Set-ExecutionPolicy restricted -Scope CurrentUser`

To set the setting back to default and you are finished.

It also automatically renames the Desktop shortcuts still work without having to run the code again even after restarting PC/Laptop.
